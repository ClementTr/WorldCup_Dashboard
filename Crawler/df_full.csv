27,Uruguay,"Sebastian Coates was first called into the national squad for the intercontinental playoff for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but he remained on the bench and did not travel to South Africa. He finally made his debut at the 2011 Copa America, lifting the trophy and picking up the Young Player of the Tournament award, and later appeared at the 2012 Men’s Olympic Football Tournament and at Brazil 2014.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/305382_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,SEBASTIAN COATES,Defender,Sebastian,Coates
31,Uruguay,"Martin Caceres rose to prominence as a technically proficient centre-back with an excellent aerial game, but is also more than capable of operating at full-back, where he has played frequently during Oscar Tabarez’s tenure – mainly on the left, but also on the right. He made eight appearances – in the first four and last four games – on the road to Russia, all from the start, and scored three important goals.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/267829_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,MARTIN CACERES,Defender,Martin,Caceres
33,Uruguay,"In total, the midfield man started 14 qualifiers, finding the net once and setting up his team-mates for no fewer than seven goals, sometimes via set pieces, the accurate delivery of which is yet another string to his bow. And although he was a substitute in the last four qualifying matches, it is likely that the experienced 33-year-old will still have an important role to play in Russia.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/392673_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,CARLOS SANCHEZ,Midfielder,Carlos,Sanchez
20,Uruguay,"Rodrigo Bentancur has gone from making his debut for Boca Juniors to playing for Italian giants Juventus in the space of two seasons, and was part of the successful Uruguayan U-20 side that claimed the South American Youth Championship and finished fourth at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2017.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/386538_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,RODRIGO BENTANCUR,Midfielder,Rodrigo,Bentancur
32,Uruguay,"In early 2017, Cristian Rodriguez returned to Penarol, where he began his career. His motives in doing so were twofold: to enjoy more playing time and increase his chances of returning to the national team. The move has worked out well. Now 32, Rodriguez is having one of the best spells of his career, prompting Oscar Tabarez to draft him into a rejuvenated _Celeste_ midfield.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/216567_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,CRISTIAN RODRIGUEZ,Midfielder,Cristian,Rodriguez
22,Uruguay,"After taking part in the early stages of the Russia 2018 qualifiers, the tireless right-sided midfielder, who enjoys making late runs into the box, then had to wait for nearly a year and a half to be named in a squad again. Nandez’s transfer to Boca Juniors, where he has excelled, triggered an international recall; he played in three of the last four qualifiers, only missing out on the final match through suspension.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/386284_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,NAHITAN NANDEZ,Midfielder,Nahitan,Nandez
22,Uruguay,"Unlike the other youngsters in the Uruguay squad, Lucas Torreira had only a brief youth international career and completed his footballing education outside the country. Torreira’s form with Sampdoria prompted Tabarez to keep a close eye on him and he earned his place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ thanks to his tactical discipline, which, added to his tireless work rate, gives _El_ _Maestro _yet more midfield options to ponder.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/371670_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,LUCAS TORREIRA,Midfielder,Lucas,Torreira
26,Uruguay,"Matias Vecino was one of the revelations of Uruguay’s 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, during which he played in 12 out of 18 possible matches. Oscar Tabarez handed him his full debut against Brazil in March 2016, and his performance in midfield was so impressive that within a few matches he had sealed a place in the team for the foreseeable future.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/337196_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,MATIAS VECINO,Midfielder,Matias,Vecino
25,Uruguay,"The athletic Montevideo native was first called up by Oscar Tabarez in March 2016, although he did not make his Uruguay debut until October of that year. Since then, he has been frequently included in national squads, but he was only used twice during the Russia 2018 qualifying campaign, both times as a substitute. However, following Laxalt’s solid performances at left-back at the China Cup in March, Tabarez decided to bring him to Russia to provide cover in that key position.",https://api.fifa.com/api/v1/picture/players/2018fwc/368657_sq-300_jpg?allowDefaultPicture=true,DIEGO LAXALT,Midfielder,Diego,Laxalt

31,Uruguay,"It was Tabarez who handed Cristhian Stuani his first cap in 2012 and made him a surprise inclusion in the squad for Brazil 2014, where the player even started in Uruguay’s opening match, in midfield. Physically strong, Stuani started out as a target man but has gradually reinvented himself during the course of his club career in Spain.
